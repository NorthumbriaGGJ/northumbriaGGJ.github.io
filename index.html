			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> is a 48 hour hackathon taking place at multiple locations around the world. The event is for everyone interested in games development, be it programming, design, narrative exploration or artistic expression.  <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> encourages people with all kinds of backgrounds to participate and contribute to this global spread of game development and creativity.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Jam" is a reference to musician jam sessions. The goal is to come together and make a videogame, or non-digital game like a board game or card game. Participants rapidly prototype game designs and hopefully inject new ideas to help grow the game industry. We share a common theme and constraints. We ask participants to create a game from beginning to end in a prescribed time (maximum of 48 hours). The brief time span is meant to help encourage creative thinking to result in small but innovative and experimental games.
