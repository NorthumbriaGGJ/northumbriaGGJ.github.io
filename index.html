		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game JamÂ®</a> is a 48 hour hackathon taking place at multiple locations around the world. The event is for everyone interested in games development, be it programming, design, narrative exploration or artistic expression.  <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> encourages people with all kinds of backgrounds to participate and contribute to this global spread of game development and creativity.
		</p>
		<p>
			The "Jam" in <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> is a reference to musician jam sessions. The goal is to come together and make a videogame, or non-digital game like a board game or card game. Participants rapidly prototype game designs and hopefully inject new ideas to help grow the game industry. Participants are asked to create a game from beginning to end in a maximum of 48 hours. The brief time span is meant to help encourage creative thinking to result in small but innovative and experimental games.
