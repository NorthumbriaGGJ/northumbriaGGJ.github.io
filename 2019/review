Dear all, 

Global Game Jam is a games hackathon that takes place at locations around the world. Last weekend Northumbria participated in this for the first time. About 20 students (about 6 some from NCL), staff and visitors produced five games. More details and download links for the games are available here:

Organising this hackathon was a team effort. The organisers were:

John Rooksby
Gavin Wood 
Tom Feltwell
Megan Doherty
Christina Vassilou
David Verweij 

We also recieved a lot of help, support and understanding from:

IT Helpline for guest accounts / IT Service's Kaveen (who went so far as to custom build a machine for running VR) / EE equipment loans - Ben Levien
The security staff
The cleaners
Shaun Lawson and Julie Walters 
Andrew Bellamy 
The department (thanks for buying us Pizza!)
Everyone involved in the experience day
Lots of other people (sorry if I've forgotten you...)

More information about the event is available here:

Global Game Jam will be on January 31-February 2 2020, and hopefully we'll be running a site here again.

Thanks,
John (on behalf of the organisers)
