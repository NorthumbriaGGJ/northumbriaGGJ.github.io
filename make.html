			<h3>How Game Jam works</h3>
			<p>
				The GGJ brings people together for a weekend to make games. It is a unique opportunity for people to create, collaborate and practice their game making skills, and invites everyone of any skill level to take part.
			</p>
			<p>
				Participants work concurrently around the globe. On the Friday evening when the event begins, a theme is announced. Participants then have 48 hours to create a game related to the theme. It's our hope that we will see some very experimental prototypes that you can continue to work on after the jam.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Participants can work individually or in teams. It is our hope that most people will work in teams. We will have a team finding session at the beginning of the event.
			</p>
			<p>
				The GGJ is open source, hardware & software agnostic and all projects are released under a Creative Commons license. We encourage people to try out new ideas and push themselves, within reason. We also strongly encourage participants to remember to eat and sleep, to stay at their best!
			</p>

			<h3>Already a confident games developer?</h3>
			<p>
				If you're confident about what you want to do at the event, be it programming, making a board game, or perhaps something specialist such as sound design or graphics, then that's great and we'll do our best to support you. Just remember the idea is to produce something new over the weekend, and the expectation is that the outcomes will be released on an open source license. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For Northumbria students wanting to use lab computers, then you can use any of the available software and we can look into installing new software where needed. Alternatively, laptops can be used. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If you already have a team in mind then that's fine, but please be open to the possibility of collaboration with others. If you don't have a team, there'll be an opportunity to find one at the event.
			</p>

			<h3>New to games and programming?</h3>
			<p>
				Never developed a game before? Don't know where to start? Or maybe you want to try doing something new? That's fine and we very much want you to attend the event. Below are some options for what you could do: 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="grid">
			<div class="ideas">
			<h3>Micro:Bit</h3>
			<p>
				A <a href="https://microbit.org/">Micro:Bit</a> is a tiny programmable computer, designed to make programming easy and fun. Several of these will be available at the event, and you will be able to program them using Scratch or Python. We can provide mentoring for teams interested in using these.
			</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section class="grid">
			<div class="ideas">
			<h3>Web</h3>
			<p>
				If you know how to use HTML, CSS, PHP and/or JavaScript, then you'll be able to make a web based game. You could use HTML, CSS and PHP to build a narrative adventure game or quiz based games. If you want to make an interactive game in JavaScript then many <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp">tutorials are available</a> - it may be easier to do than you think! If you want to be a bit more ambitious, you could try a framework such as <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>.

			<h3>Board games & card games</h3>
			<p>
				There's no requirement to make computer games. We welcome people who would like to work on a board game, or perhaps something weird and wonderful. Bring some pens and cardboard!
			</p>

			<h3>Processing</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://processing.org/">Processing<a> is an easy to use tool for artists and creatives, and is great for new programmers too. Here are <a href="https://www.openprocessing.org/curation/25/">some example games</a> made with Processing.

			<h3>Other options</h3>
			<p>
				There are many other options for people that are new (or not so new) to games programming. Mentors will be available at the event, and you might just pick up some new skills...
